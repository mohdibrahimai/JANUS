"""Adapter for TruthLens evaluation metrics.

TruthLens is an external library for assessing the factual correctness of
statements and the precision of citations.  This module provides a
placeholder interface that returns dummy scores for support, contradict
and unverifiable metrics, as well as citation precision.

In a real deployment you should import and call TruthLens (or a similar
NLI‑based evaluation model) here.
