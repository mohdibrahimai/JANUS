"""
Continuous integration gate definitions for JANUS.

This YAML file defines threshold values for various metrics that must be
satisfied before merging changes.  In a real project, these gates would
be enforced by a CI pipeline (see `ci/workflow.yml`).  The current
values are placeholders and should be tuned based on your requirements.
