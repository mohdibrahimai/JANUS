"""Cost‑aware bandit fine‑tuning for JANUS.

This module is intended to implement a cost‑aware bandit fine‑tuning
procedure on top of the initial DPO/ORPO policy.  It is left as a stub
because implementing a contextual bandit with custom reward functions
requires substantial infrastructure (e.g. online serving, reward signals
from truth/citation and latency metrics).  In a research setting you can
simulate this by evaluating candidate policies on an offline dataset and
updating their parameters accordingly.

Currently, the module exposes a placeholder function `fine_tune` that
returns the input policy unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    policy: Dict[str, Any]
        The current policy parameters.
    logs: Any
        Offline logs or simulated interactions containing reward signals.

    Dict[str, Any]
        The updated policy.  At the moment this simply returns the input.
